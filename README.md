Manipulate the dataset using SAS Studio software and to produce a report
that contains appropriate graphs and statistics in order to provide useful insights for business

### Note:
- Manipulate a raw dataset. This means checking for missing values, duplicates, inconsistent entries (wrong values), variable names and labels, format, etc. Create new variables from the existing ones.

- transform the raw dataset into a structured form and to create a report that provides insights to the analyst for further and more complex analyses. tell a story with the report, do analyses that mean something!

- code has to be automated. It is able to do manipulation, run analyses and create the report after press run. It can be successfully exported to different formats such as Word, PDF or Powerpoint.
